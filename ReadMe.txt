This is a project that aims at collating Bash.org quotes and displaying a random quote each time someone presses the 'Get a Quote!' button. 

The idea is to scale it up to see if I can auto scrape quotes and add 50-100 quotes as part of a cronjob at the end of each day.

It's my first project, starting it out in HTML/CSS & JavaScript. Let's see where it goes.
